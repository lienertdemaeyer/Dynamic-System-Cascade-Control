# Dynamic-System-Cascade-Control
A dynamic system model for cascade control of liquid level in a water tank. This project includes an analysis of a solenoid valve as a mass-spring-damper system, derivation of system transfer functions, state-space representation, and simulations with and without control. Ideal for exploring control theory applications in hydraulic systems.
